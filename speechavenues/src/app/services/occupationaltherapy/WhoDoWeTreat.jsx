            <strong>Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD):</strong> SPD may have
            difficulty processing sensory input, which can lead to behavioral
            challenges, difficulty focusing, or aversions to textures and
            sounds. Through sensory integration therapy, OT will help regulate
            sensory experiences and improve the ability to participate in daily
            activities.

              Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) / Neurodivergent Individuals:

            Patients with ASD and other neurodivergent individuals may often
            face challenges with social skills, communication, transitions, and
            repetitive behaviors. We develop therapy programs that focus on
            improving interaction, enhancing motor skills, and building
            independence through sensory and motor activities tailored to each
            person's strengths.

                <strong>Developmental Delays:</strong> Patients with
                developmental delays may struggle with fine and gross motor
                skills, speech, or daily self-care tasks. Through play-based
                therapy and exercises tailored to developmental milestones, we
                help children gain confidence and achieve greater independence
                at home and school.

                Patients with seizure disorders often experience disruptions in
                coordination, attention, and/or memory. Our therapists focus on
                promoting safety, managing triggers, and teaching compensatory
                techniques for cognitive and motor challenges. We help
                individuals develop strategies to regain independence in daily
                activities like work, self-care, and other community
                involvement.

            Learning disabilities can impact a childâ€™s ability to perform school
            tasks, such as reading, writing, or processing and retaining
            information. Our therapists use a combination of cognitive
            strategies, handwriting training, and adaptive learning tools to
            improve academic performance and boost confidence. We also provide
            support for organizational and study skills to help better manage

              Occupational therapy (OT) is a branch of healthcare with
              professionals dedicated to empowering patients of all ages to
              achieve independence and enhance their quality of life through
              meaningful everyday activities, known as occupations.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Our OT practitioners work with individuals throughout all stages
              of life who may be facing various physical, cognitive,
              developmental, or emotional challenges.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              By collaborating with patients to set personalized goals and
              develop tailored treatment plans, occupational therapy facilitates
              individuals' engagement in daily activities, promotes overall
              well-being, and maximizes independence across all life domains.

              Services provided by our occupational therapists encompass a wide
              range of interventions, including: assessing and improving fine
              motor skills, balance, emotional regulation, self-care abilities,

              Additionally, our occupational therapists specialize in sensory
              integration techniques:

                <li className="mb-2">
                  Sensory integration is the brain's ability to process and make
                  sense of sensory information.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Techniques aim to regulate sensory input, improve body
                  awareness, coordination, and overall self-regulation.

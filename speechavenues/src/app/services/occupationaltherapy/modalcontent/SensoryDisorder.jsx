        , sensory processing is the neurology of how we feel. The sensory
        messages we receive from our bodies and the world around us are
        responded to in everything that we do.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <span className="font-bold">Sensory Processing Disorder</span> is a
        condition where the brain has difficulty receiving and responding to
        information that comes through our senses. People with SPD may have
        heightened sensitivity to sensory stimuli, such as sounds, smells,
        lights, textures, or they may seek out sensory input to a greater extent
        than others. They may also have difficulty integrating and organizing
        sensory input, leading to challenges in regulating their emotions,
        behavior, and motor skills. SPD can come in various forms and can
        co-occur with other conditions such as ASD, ADHD, anxiety, etc.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        People of all genders, races, ethnicities, and economic backgrounds can
        be diagnosed with SPD.

        Teaching Strategies for SPD:
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        SPD can make school difficult for some individuals. It can be
        overwhelming, or they may have trouble paying attention because they may
        be uncomfortable.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc px-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Keep a calm, even tone of voice.</li>
        <li>Dim the lights.</li>
        <li>Play calming music at a low volume.</li>
        <li>Some children feel more comfortable sitting near the teacher.</li>
        <li>
          Try a seated cushion for those who may tend to move around a bit
          (squirm).
        </li>
        <li>Allow fidgets.</li>
        <li>
          Allow time for a break for physical activity (even if it's just a
          3-minute brain break).
        </li>
        <li>Remain inclusive at all times.</li>
        <li>Promote a welcoming, calm, happy, fun environment.</li>
        <li>Use positive reinforcement.</li>
        <li>Allow time to work in pairs with positive peers.</li>
        <li>
          Announce daily activities first thing to help with the transition
          process from play to learning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use descriptive praise to build desired behaviors. For example, “I
          really liked how you threw that trash away! That was an excellent job
          putting your trash in the trash can!”
        </li>
        <li>
          Minimize usage of “No”, “Stop”, “Don’t”. Try using positive directions
          instead.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Calming Activities, Meltdowns, Sensory Integration Techniques:
      </h3>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Please refer to the “What Is ASD” section for the difference between a{' '}
        <span className="italic font-semibold">“meltdown”</span> and a
        <span className="italic font-semibold">“tantrum”</span>.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        When an individual with SPD reaches an overwhelming amount or “sensory
        overload”, they may experience a range of reactions depending on the
        severity of their case. These reactions may include feeling overwhelmed,
        anxious, irritable, eloping, disrobing, or even resulting in a meltdown.
        It is often hard for individuals to calm down. Remember to remain
        patient and even-toned. It's important to work through these moments and
        show your support. When the individual has calmed, remind them that they
        are in a safe environment.

        What is Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)?
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Per the{' '}
        <span className="italic">National Institute of Mental Health</span>,
        “Autism Spectrum Disorder is a neurological and developmental disorder
        that affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn, and
        behave.”
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        According to the{' '}
        <span className="italic">
          Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)
        </span>
        , individuals and children often have difficulty with communication and
        repetitive behaviors. Symptoms often affect their ability to function in
        school, work, and other areas of life.

      <p className="mb-4">
        Autism Spectrum Disorder can vary in the type and severity of the
        case/symptoms. National University reminds us that ASD is not a learning
        (intellectual) disability. ASD is associated with symptoms such as
        motion, repetitive actions, difficulty socializing, and compulsive
        behaviors. This can still create challenges within the curriculum.
        However, some individuals may be non-verbal and use an AAC device.

        Teaching Strategies per “AutismSpeaks.org”:
      </h3>
      <ul className="list-disc px-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>
          Remain calm and positive. Model the behavior for the student with
          autism, as well as others.
        </li>
        <li>Limit sensory overload.</li>
        <li>Remain inclusive at all times.</li>
        <li>Promote a welcoming, calm, happy, fun environment.</li>
        <li>Use positive reinforcement.</li>
        <li>Allow time to work in pairs with positive peers.</li>
        <li>
          Announce what activities you will be doing today, first thing to help
          with the transition process from play to learn.
        </li>
        <li>Focus on autism reading comprehension strategies.</li>
        <li>
          Use descriptive praise to build desired behaviors. E.g., “I really
          liked how you threw that trash away! That was an excellent job putting
          your trash in the trash can!”
        </li>
        <li>
          Minimize usage of “No”, “Stop”, “Don’t”. Try using positive directions
          instead.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Calming Activities, Meltdowns, Sensory Integration Techniques:
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Per Autism.org, meltdowns can happen and are challenging to navigate,
        but the root of a meltdown and a{' '}
        <span className="italic">“tantrum”</span> are very different. It is
        important to remember that sometimes individuals have difficulty
        expressing their needs and emotions. Understanding this is essential for
        caregivers, teachers, therapists, and all parties involved.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A <span className="font-bold">tantrum</span> is an emotional outburst
        with specific goals or functions. It is a learned behavioral response
        used to attain the desired outcome (e.g., getting out of an activity,
        gaining more attention). Tantrums typically happen deliberately, and the
        individual maintains control over their body and mind the entire time.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A <span className="font-bold">meltdown</span> is an involuntary response
        to nervous system overload. They are not behavioral responses or
        “maliciously planned”. The reaction cannot be controlled as intense
        emotions take over. Once the individual has reached this point, it can
        be difficult to bring them back down. During this time, it may be hard
        to get the individual to listen to You, as they are experiencing intense
        feelings. It is crucial to stay present throughout this. Remember to
        remain calm and even-toned. Explain to others that the your child is in
        a moment of crisis and needs time to work through it. Every behavior has
        an escalation rise and de-escalation falling point that can be charted
        and timed. It is equally important to watch for signs and understand the
        fluctuations. When the individual has calmed, remind them that they are
        safe and supported.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Sensory inputs are the first way we interact with and understand the
        world around us. Our sensory systems include touch, smell, sound, sight,
        bodily sensations, and movements. Many core symptoms of autism are
        related to sensory processing, communication, and emotional regulation.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc px-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Dim the lights.</li>
        <li>Play calming music at a low volume.</li>
        <li>
          Count to ten with the individual (forwards and backwards, if
          possible).
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide something tactile / Get a weighted blanket or weighted lap
          pad.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring them to a <span className="font-bold">“Retreat Zone”</span> or{' '}
          <span className="font-bold">“Safe Room”</span> (a place where they can
          be alone, with a supervising adult, that will allow them to relax and
          take a break from the sensory stimulation).

              Adults acquire speech and language disabilities through organic
              and nonorganic causes, such as a stroke, Parkinsonâ€™s, dementia,
              etc. Treatment for adults is known as rehabilitation. It is
              rehabilitation because the therapist is attempting to restore the
              previously learned skill. A nonorganic cause might be traumatic
              head injury from a car accident.

            <p>
              Although every case is different, communication disorders seen
              most in treating adults are voice disorders, motor speech
              disorders, other neurologically based communicative disorders, and
              non-neurological disorders.

          Services provided by our occupational therapists here at SATC
          encompass a wide range of interventions, including: assessing and
          improving fine motor skills, balance, emotional regulation, self-care
          abilities, cognitive functions, and more.
        </p>
        <div>
          Additionally, our occupational therapists specialize in sensory
          integration techniques:
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2">
            <li>
              Sensory integration is the brain's ability to process and make
              sense of sensory information.
            </li>
            <li>
              Techniques aim to regulate sensory input, improve body awareness,
              coordination, and overall self-regulation.
            </li>

          Lastly, being able to work alongside our wonderful Speech-Language
          Pathologists (SLPs), our Occupational Therapists are able to support
          and treat individuals in improving speech, language techniques,
          communication, and expression skills by addressing possible underlying
          sensory and motor components.

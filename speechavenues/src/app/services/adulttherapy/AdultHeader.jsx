            Adults acquire speech and language disabilities through organic and
            nonorganic causes, such as a stroke, Parkinsonâ€™s, dementia, etc.
            Treatment for adults is known as rehabilitation. It is
            rehabilitation because the therapist is attempting to restore the
            previously learned skill. A nonorganic cause might be traumatic head
            injury from a car accident.

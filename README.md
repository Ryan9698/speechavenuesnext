Speech Avenues site using Next.js

Design by Ryan Caltabiano (Webpulse Designs)

v 2.0.0 (6/24/25) - Refactored file structure and removal of unnecessary dependencies. To make program more lightweight, removed react image gallery and wrote a script for basic gallery rendering. Added pages for images to improve load times and organize content. Beyond refactoring code to make it more modular and meaningful, bloat was removed and components were restructured/improved overall from acquired knowledge since this project began. More readable fonts were included and theme of site is more consistent with their other project for brand identity. Finally, included backlinks to relevant sites (school sites and personal page via footer).

v 1.0.0 (2024) - First iteration of project with completed pages using react image gallery to power their images and carousel.

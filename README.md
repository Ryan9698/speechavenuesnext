Design by Ryan Caltabiano (Webpulse Designs)

v 1.5.5 - (7/10/25) - Large refactors and modularization of code into manageable blocks. Improved overall aesthetic to all pages to create consistency with their school page. Many files have been broken down and restructured with respect to semantics to improve SEO performance. Removed large chunks of unnecessary code and improved the functions of the site. Largest improvenent was utilizing slugs to create dynamic links for their large content blocks rather than dropdowns or modals. Introduced a light color scheme to complement the brand and enhance the aesthetics of the website. Designed pages to be consistent with one another and each has been modularized into several functions to streamline future updates and changes to the site. In the process of creating an FAQ Hub which will organize all information that is not available in the main site pages to be easily accessible from a central "hub." At this point the rework of the site is about halfway complete.

v 1.5.0 (6/24/25) - Refactored file structure and removal of unnecessary dependencies. To make program more lightweight, utlized basic code to create dynamic rendering of photos in the different pages. Added pagination for images to improve load times and organize content. Beyond refactoring code to make it more modular and meaningful, bloat was removed and components were restructured/improved overall from acquired knowledge since this project began. More readable fonts were included and theme of site is more consistent with their other project for brand identity. Finally, included backlinks to relevant sites (school sites and personal page via footer).

v 1.0.0 (2024) - First iteration of project with completed pages using react image gallery to power their images and carousel.
